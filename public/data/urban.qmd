  <title>2016 Generalized Land Use</title>
  <abstract>-----------------2016 Generalized Landuse------------------
Metro Vancouver’s 2016 Generalized Land Use has no official status. It is neither a zoning nor an Official Community Plan map but rather a serves as a ‘regional reference map’ that depicts land activities existing in fall 2016. The 2016 Generalized Land Use is intended to provide a consistent interpretation of on-the-ground land development activity across the Metro Vancouver’s member municipalities, electoral area, and First Nation territories. Based on British Columbia Assessment Authority parcel data, aerial photograph interpretation plus other land data information, land use activities were categorized into one of the twenty-nine classifications defined below.
Metro Vancouver’s 2016 Generalized Land Use map was compiled using a consistent interpretation of all available information. Every effort was made to depict land use activities accurately and consistently across all of the region’s municipalities. Land use classifications were assigned at the municipal cadastre geography wherein each parcel was assigned one single land use classification. Exceptions to this rule occurred in instances where cadastre lots clearly had more than one discrete land use activity which did not fit into one single classification thus requiring the cadastre lot to be split to accommodate multiple land use activities. Exceptions included: hydro right-of-way corridors and school properties (school buildings were classified as ‘Health and Education’ and playing fields coded as ‘Recreation, Open Space and Protected Natural Areas’).
